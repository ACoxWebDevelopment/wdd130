            <div class="testimonial"><p>When my son first suggested this as a mother/son activity following his graduation from high school, I thought no way this is too dangerous.  When I saw the boats and the rapids I was genuinely afraid for my life.  We did it and now my son thinks I'm the best mom ever (he's right).</p></div>
            <div class="testimonial"><p>Al's White Water Rafting was the perfect choice for us!  We weren't sure anyone could accommodate our entire church youth group, but we all had an incredible time.</p></div>
