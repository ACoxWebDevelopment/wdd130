<p>My name is Allan Cox.  This is my first experience with building a web page.  I am excited to learn more skills in web development and use my new skills to supplement my income.  I also enjoy the mountains and other natural beauty that exists in Montana.  I live near Bozeman with my beuatiful bride of 29 years and my 2 college age boys.  I also have a daughter who is married and lives in Utah.</p>
